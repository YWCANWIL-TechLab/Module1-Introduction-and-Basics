            <h1>Exercise 1: Elements</h1>
            <p>
                Elements are how we display information on web pages. Most elements will have a start and an end tag.
                The elements we will be using in this exercise are the different headings, paragraphs, anchors, and
                divs. We haven't covered divs yet, but for now just know that they contain other elements.
            </p>

                There is a tradition in programming that every time you learn a new language, especially your first
                one, the first thing your output is the phrase "Hello World!". Inside the div with an id of "answers", 
                create a new h1 heading. Between the start and end tag, please write "Hello World!".
